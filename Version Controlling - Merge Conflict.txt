Merge Conflict

In version controller automatically changes occure, 
If git cant perform merge changes automatically conflict occures

Solution

	Manually check and do changes is not possible in large projects so branching is used.
	Allow Devs to work indivitually
	Sandbox concept (Explain)

After completing entire feature send a pull request -> upon verification compare from base (main) and (dev), merge changes to main
also, merge can be accepted or declined by repository owner (can also accpted by any but mostly done a privilage repository owner)

Once the feature is done branch is deleted (Industry Practice)

When naming branches there is a rule 
	Standard: feature/<Person-who-is-working-on>/<The-feature-that-you-are-on>

For each updates do Hotfix(Minor bugs)
